    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Biryani is a popular and flavorful South Asian dish, particularly in India and Pakistan. It's a fragrant and savory rice dish made by cooking rice with a variety of spices, vegetables, and often a choice of meat, such as chicken, mutton, or seafood. Biryani can also be made in a vegetarian version with ingredients like paneer (Indian cottage cheese) or vegetables. The key to biryani's distinct taste is the combination of aromatic spices like cumin, coriander, cardamom, and saffron, which infuse the rice with a rich and savory flavor. The dish is typically garnished with fried onions, fresh herbs, and sometimes served with yogurt-based raita or a side salad. Biryani comes in various regional variations, each with its unique ingredients and preparation methods. It's a beloved and widely enjoyed dish known for its delicious, complex flavors.</p>

            <h3 class="step-heading">Prepare saffron-kewra water and chop veggies</h3>
            <p>To make a delightful chicken biryani dish, firstly soak saffron in water to prepare saffron water (one
                tsp saffron can be soaked in 1/4 cup water). Next, mix kewra drops in water and mix well to make kewra
                water. Set them aside for later usage. Now, chop the onion and coriander leaves and keep them aside.</p>

        </li>
        <li>
            <h3 class="step-heading">Saute the onions</h3>
            <p>Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a deep bottomed pan. Once the oil is hot enough, add cumin seeds, bay leaf,
                green cardamom, black cardamom, cloves in it, and saute for about a minute. Then, add chopped onion to
                it and saute until pink. Now, add chicken into it with slit green chillies, turmeric, salt to taste,
                ginger-garlic paste, red chilli powder and green chilli paste. Mix well all the spices and cook for 2-3
                minutes. Then, add hung curd into it and give a mix. (Make sure the chicken is washed properly and
                patted dry before adding it to the dish)</p>

            <h3 class="step-heading">
                Cook biryani on low heat for 5-6 minutes
            </h3>
            <p>Turn the flame to medium again and add garam masala in it along with ginger julienned, coriander and
                mint leaves. Add kewra water, rose water and 1 tsp saffron water in it. Cook till the chicken is tender.
                Then add 1 cup cooked rice and spread evenly. Then add the remaining saffron water and pour ghee over
                it. You can now cook the dish without the lid or cover it with a lid to give a dum-effect due to the
                steam formation.</p>
